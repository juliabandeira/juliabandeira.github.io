        <p>
          I’m the youngest child of four siblings. Born in the least fun region
          of Brazil (the south), my childhood/teenage years would make Eleanor
          Shellstrop scream “ya basic”.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a political scientist. As I grew up I started to wonder how the
          world works, and why it works the way it does. Therefore, when I had
          to choose the path I would trail, political science was an obvious
          choice. During my undergrad and graduate degrees, I leaned over the
          different political systems, studying from how unicameralism impacts
          decision-making to what guides the vote of a citizen in the smallest
          rural areas. Throughout this period I also learned that politics could
          be intensively dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a Ph.D. student dropout. Although I had a decade-long research
          career, publishing book chapters and articles in leading academic
          journals (you can check my academic CV <a href="cv.html">here</a>), I
          decided that I want to work with something less chaotic than Latin
          American politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a political scientist, I was trained to think in a completely
          different way than a front-end developer thinks since politics
          frequently are not based on logic. And that’s exactly what draws me
          into the front-end developer career: work with something immerse in
          logic to try to solve problems that actually can be solved. Also, I
          think that the tech industry, on one hand, is a potent instrument to
          increase inequalities (between individuals and between countries) and
          foster totalitarian aims, while on the other hand, it may contribute
          to the exact opposite. In other words, the tech industry can promote,
          more than any other industry, equality and democratization. In this
          sense, I hope that someday my work contributes to this aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a front-end developer. Or, maybe I’m not, since I have zero
          professional experience, but I’m eager to have a chance to start this
          new path. I love to learn and I grasp new knowledge quickly, so I’m
          sure I will be a valuable asset wherever I land.

          Build tools to help governments and people of developing countries
          like mine strengthen democracy. Do you know that many of these
          countries either do not have operative websites or rely on outdated
          designs that make it impossible to find any relevant information?
          Therefore, I would be thrilled to engage with governmental departments
          and agencies to improve their websites, fostering transparency and
          disseminating information.
